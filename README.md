# FED-Template
## Starter setup for front-end design with gulp
##### Very basic node server
not too useful unless you're used to `npm start`ing your projects

##### Gulp functions for automating styles testing
- watchCSS
- watchFiles

##### As well as individual functions
that take part in the automation functions for more specific isolated uses
- concatScripts
- minifyJS
- compileSass
- minifyCSS
- clearCSS
- clearJS
- clean

each named very self explanitory and should work as long as the file stays updated as the directory gets updated.
